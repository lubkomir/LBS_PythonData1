# LBS_PythonData1
My Python data science project 1 

I used a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club, adjusted by Jose Marcial Portilla.

First there is a dataset exploration analysis then trasnformation of cathegorical data into numerical variables with feature engineering missing data followed by creation of Deep Neural Network model trained locally on my GPU in Tensorflow 2.14.0
